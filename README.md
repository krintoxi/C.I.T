## Description

A powerful Python script developed by **Intercuba.Net**, with **Krintoxi** as the chief developer. This toolkit is designed to provide cybersecurity professionals, data analysts, and project managers with a comprehensive suite of tools. It offers a versatile and modular solution that empowers users to effectively tackle various tasks related to cybersecurity, data analysis, and project management.

### Authentication

Access to the toolkit's features is secured through an access key, ensuring that only authorized users can leverage its capabilities.

### Admin Panel Finder (`apf`)

Quickly discover hidden admin panels on websites with the help of the `APF.py` script. This feature aids in locating entry points for website exploration.

### Terminal Access (`terminal`)

Gain access to a secure terminal environment. If the required terminal emulator is not available, the toolkit will automatically install it.

### Cybersecurity Utilities

Utilize a range of cybersecurity tools, including SQL injection detection (`sqli`), vulnerability scanning (`vulscan`), analysis of different hash types, and more.

### Data Analysis Tools

Effortlessly perform data analysis tasks with tools such as dataset breakdown (`analyze_dataset`), report generation (`generate_report`), data visualization (`visualize_data`), and more.

### Project Management Features (`panel`)

Take advantage of project management tools for tasks, intelligence gathering, and collaboration, all integrated within the toolkit.

### System Information (`sys`)

Obtain insights into the operating environment by using the `lsb_release -a` command.

### Miscellaneous Options

Expand the toolkit's capabilities with versatile functionalities like configuring Tor (`itor`), accessing shells (`shells`), using PHP tools (`phptools`), and more.

### Local and Network Port Scanning

Conduct discreet scans of local and network ports to gather information about potential vulnerabilities.

### Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) (`osint`)

Leverage OSINT techniques to extract valuable information from publicly available sources.

### Image Metadata Extraction and Removal (`exif`)

Analyze image metadata using the `exifpwn.py` script, enabling the extraction and sanitization of metadata to reveal hidden insights.

### Local MAC Address Spoofing (`spoof my mac`)

Enhance anonymity by utilizing the `macspoof.py` script to change your device's MAC address.

### Easter Eggs

Discover hidden features within the toolkit for delightful surprises and experiences.
